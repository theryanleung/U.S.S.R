                This Russian general fought with the Russian cavalry back in 1467, he was a formidable<br /> general because of his size, body odor, and strategic genius he was one of the best general <br />Russia has ever had.
                but because of his intimidating personality and his green <br />appearance he never was great with people.
            In total he fought in 1 war in which he had to <br />get a special donkey as many were not up to the task.
        the stories of his heroic actions have been told for generations, but today only mere shadows of his glory can be heard from local children.
