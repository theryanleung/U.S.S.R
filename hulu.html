    <div class="huluheader">cthulhu, a sea angel or a danger to soceity?</div>
    <div class="hulutitle">many people have pondered this question, we collected and analyed the pros and cons for you.</div>
<div class="huluimg"><img src="img/cthulhu.img" title="cthulhu"></div>
<div class="huluprosandcons">pro 1, cthulhu is a potentialy a great source of green energy</div>
<p class="hulutext">with its gargantuan size, extacting power by exploiting its powerful muscles, climate change? what change. the amount of green energy possible is surmountable. 
    
</p>
<hr />
<div class="huluprosandcons">pro 2, hulu is a mythical creature</div>
<p class="hulutext">first of all, name 1 living organism that is a mythical creature of comparable size, I'll wait... yeah that's what I thought. 
    we talk about killing and harvesting the bodies of common leveled animals but to insult our one
    chosen god and putting it down to levels lower than COMMON animals like chickens and cows it straight up disgusting
    and rude to the legacy of ancient sea creatures. 
</p>
<hr />
<div class="huluprosandcons">pro 3, the cthulhu spieces is almost extinct</div>
<p class="hulutext">
    for the longest time ancient civilizations have worshipped the god and it has never attacked any human community before. 
    but as it's numbers dwindled and our sanity decreased it was outcasted and sealed in an giant iron maiden. now that we
    have antaginaized it, we can't not be responcible for it's fate. 
</p>
<hr />
<div class="huluprosandcons">pro 4, Cthulhu looks pretty cool</div>
<p class="hulutext">Damn boi cthulhu looks so cool. its has glowing eyes allowing him to see 50% better underwater. He was tenticle apendages aloowing him to grasp and hold 
    objects with ease. But most of all his enourmouse appearance shows how jacked it is.  </p>
    <hr />
<div class="huluprosandcons">pro 5, Cthulhu holds the rocord for largest animal on the earth</div>
<p>cthulhu holds the record for largest creature or abomination however you look at it. he is the size of a mountain. he can kill a fully grown brown bear with one look. 
    a fully grown big foot could fit in the grooves of his finger prints. 
</p>

<hr />
<div class="huluprosandcons">con 1 cthulhu is destroying coastal Russian cities</div>
<p class="hulutext">no matter what weastern media can say. it is clear that destroying the communitys and livly hoods of coastal villages is. 
    the Russian forces have been havign trouble containg the god as non of their weapons can peirce his thicc hide. 
    just yesterday cthulhu destroyed the coastal community of Nagayevo, Magadan at aproximitly 3am. 
</p>

<hr />
<div class="huluprosandcons">con 2 cthulhu is a hideous creature</div>
<p class="hulutext">to some cthulhu is a magestic galant creature which can charm and bewitch the souls of unworthy travelers, but for the other 99.9% of people, cthulhu is an abonination no words could describe his ambigouse shape yet I am describing them to you now. </p>
