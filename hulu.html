    <div class="huluheader">Cthulhu, a Sea Angel or a Danger to Society?</div>
    <div class="hulutitle">Many people have pondered this question, we collected and analyzed the pros and cons for you.</div>
<div class="huluimg"><img src="img/cthulhu.img" title="cthulhu"></div>
<div class="huluprosandcons">Pro 1, Cthulhu is potentialy a great source of green energy</div>
<p class="hulutext">With its gargantuan size, extacting power by exploiting its powerful muscles. The amount of green energy possible is enormous. 
    
</p>
<hr />
<div class="huluprosandcons">Pro 2, Cthulhu is a Mythical Creature</div>
<p class="hulutext">First of all, name one living organism that is a mythical creature of comparable size, I'll wait... yeah that's what I thought. 
    We talk about killing and harvesting the bodies of common leveled animals but to insult our one
    chosen god and putting it down to levels lower than COMMON animals like chickens and cows it straight up disgusting
    and rude to the legacy of ancient sea creatures. 
</p>
<hr />
<div class="huluprosandcons">Pro 3, the Cthulhu species is almost Extinct</div>
<p class="hulutext">
    For the longest time ancient civilizations have worshipped the god and it has never attacked any human community before. 
    However, as it's numbers dwindled and our sanity decreased it was outcasted and sealed in an giant iron maiden. Now that we
    have antagonized it, we can't not be responcible for it's fate. 
</p>
<hr />
<div class="huluprosandcons">Pro 4, Cthulhu looks Pretty Cool</div>
<p class="hulutext">Damn boi Cthulhu looks so cool. It has glowing eyes allowing it to see 50% better underwater. It has tenticle appendages allowing it to grasp and hold 
    objects with ease. But most of all it's enormous appearance shows how jacked it is.  </p>
    <hr />
<div class="huluprosandcons">Pro 5, Cthulhu holds the Record for Largest Animal on Earth</div>
<p>Cthulhu holds the record for largest creature or abomination however you look at it. It is the size of a mountain. It can kill a fully grown brown bear with one look. 
    A fully grown big foot could fit in the grooves of it's finger prints. 
</p>

<hr />
<div class="huluprosandcons">Con 1, Cthulhu is Destroying Coastal Russian Cities</div>
<p class="hulutext">No matter what western media can say. It is clear that destroying the communities and lively hoods of coastal villages is a dire situation.
    The Russian forces have been having trouble containing the god as none of their weapons can pierce it's thick hide. 
    Just yesterday Cthulhu destroyed the coastal community of Nagayevo, Magadan at aproximitly 3AM. 
</p>

<hr />
<div class="huluprosandcons">Con 2, Cthulhu is a Hideous Creature</div>
<p class="hulutext">To some Cthulhu is a magestic and galant creature which can charm and bewitch the souls of unworthy travelers, but for the other 99.9% of people, Cthulhu is an abonination, that no words could describe it, yet I am describing them to you now. </p>
